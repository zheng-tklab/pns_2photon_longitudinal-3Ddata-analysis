Peripheral neural system in two-photon longitudinal 3D data analysis

These codes are written in matlab, users can test single images or large-scale 4D datasets in a single PC or in High performance computers (HPC).

Steps of 2-photon data processing and quantitative analysis

I. Step 1: Automated stitching of four 16-bit raw image stacks into a superstack

II. Step 2: Identification and removal of epidermal autofluorescence via weakly-supervised learning and label propagation

III. Step 3: Method of Adaptive enhancement and conversion of 16bit images to 8bit images

IV. Step 4: Automated rigid and non-rigid 4D registration of stacks acquired at different time points

V. Step 5: Automated neuronal segmentation, tracing and statistical neural network analysis

VI. Step 6: Quantitative analysis of structural plasticity in SNS-mGFP and Thy1-YFP mice.

How to use:

Users can first download the file by click the menu "code", download the zip file.
Since these codes are written in matlab, you can run the code step by step in matlab.
Users can use your own two-photon image stacks for testing or can use our datasets for testing.
