
PNS 2photon longitudinal 3Ddata analysis

The code are written in matlab, one can test single images or large-scale 4D datasets in a single PC or in High performance computers (HPC).


Steps of data processing and analysis

I. Automated stitching of four 16-bit raw image stacks into a superstack

II. Identification and removal of epidermal autofluorescence via weakly-supervised learning and label propagation 

III. Automated rigid and non-rigid 4D registration of stacks acquired at different time points

IV. Automated neuronal segmentation, tracing and statistical neural network analysis

V. Quantitative analysis of structural plasticity in SNS-mGFP and Thy1-YFP mice.

1. Users can first download the file by click the menu "code", select download the zip file.
2. Since the codes are written in matlab, you can run the code step by step in matlab.
3. Users can use your own two-photon image stacks for testing or can use our datasets for testing.
